## Step Two Review

Open up the `ex_two_classes.dart` file and take a look at the answers. Did you do anything differently?

Does anything not make sense? **Speak now or forever hold your bugs**

---

## Step Three

Let's get fluttered

In this branch, we have a folder (called `ex_three`) that is the flutter sample app.

You can create your own instead by running `flutter create <name>` in the `code` folder

---

## App Structure - Folders

* `android/` - Android native code (open in Android Studio)
* `ios/` - You guessed it, native iOS code (open in Xcode)
* `lib/` - **Dart** code, let's code here!
* `test/` - All of your unit tests go here!
* `pubspec.yaml` - This is your package file that details the metadata of your app and handles builds

---

## App Structure - Code

The native projects for each platform is in the `android` and `ios` file but the `lib` folder is where we will spend our time today.

Let's take a look at a `main.dart` generated by the sample app.

---

## Dart

Two things we should note here:
1. This is an intro to mobile development, Dart is a language with many features we cannot cover in this time
2. Flutter is built all around **WIDGETS**, everything is a widget

---

## `main.dart` Walkthrough

For those not following on the course, the file is well commented so take a look and run it with `flutter run`

You can launch an emulator with `flutter emulators --launch apple_ios_simulator`

---

## Playtime

Complete the TODOs in `main.dart` and hit `r` to reload the app to see changes

Have fun messing around!
