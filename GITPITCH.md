## Step One Review

Open up the `ex_one.dart` file and take a look at the answers. Did you do anything differently?

Does anything not make sense? **Speak now or forever hold your bugs**

## Step Two

But we have already made an app, I hear you cry. Well, now let's take a quick look at some classes before we get stuck into flutter.

Open up `ex_two_classes.dart` and take a look at the class inside.

Work through the TODOs and we will cover these in the next branch.

## Mobile Development

Here, we focus on Android mainly becuase we can develop on OSX, Linux or Windows. If you want to build for iOS then you **must** use a Mac. In this workshop, I will provide iOS examples and builds on my machine but feel free to give it a go if you have one.

## Command Line

The flutter command line tool has some key functionality:
* `flutter doctor` - Make sure flutter has been installed and is working on your system
* `flutter clean` - Got a problem? Always run this first!
* `flutter build` - Build commands for your apps
* `flutter run` - Run the app on the connected device (physical or virtual)
* `flutter test` - Run all the tests on your app

## IDE

Flutter and Dart work in almost every text editor or IDE with plugins you can find. However, I recommend Visual Studio Code because of the awesome plugin support. Android Studio or Jetbrains are also great options so go with what you know.

For this workshop, let's use Visual Studio Code and add the `flutter` plugin.

We have 10 mins to set it all up and then we can get FLUTTERED!
