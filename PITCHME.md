## What is Flutter?

Flutter is a framework, developed by Google, that creates cross-platform mobile apps using their language: Dart.
In short, this is a framework that allows you to create apps on both major platforms using a single codebased and the development benefits of the web, such as `Hot Reload`

---

## Too Good Too Be True?

It is. Flutter is a very new framework and Dart is a language with a lot of potential but is not yet a mainstream language.

---

### So Why Learn for Beginners?

While many larger companies have not yet heard of Flutter (or Dart), it is a good option for startups with not so much (wo)manpower.

On top of this, Dart is not so different as a language, you will see similarities between Java and JavaScript.

Finally, the tools are not specific. Want to edit the code? Use Android Studio. Knowing how to use the emulator and the IDE is a vital mobile development skill.

## Step One

#### Introduction to Dart

Let's start by going through some of the basics of the Dart language, what it is for and what it does.

NOTE: This is less of an introduction, but more to Flutter and resources for the language will be highlighted here.

---

## Dart - Why?

Dart is a `strongly-typed` language originally developed to replace JavaScript, it has now progressed to support mobile apps and is now also supported on the server.

---

## A Program in Dart

```Dart
void main() {
  for (int i = 0; i <  10; i++) {
    print(' The counter is ${i}');
  }
}
```

---

## Easy, right?

You may recognise a lot of this, but let's go through some basics.

* All programs need a `main` function.
* Types for variables are expected, but Dart can infer types.
* This looks a lot like other compiled languages, right?

---

### Let's get started!

1. Open the `ex_one.dart`, run it with `dart ex_one.dart`
2. Complete the `TODOS` in the file
3. When done, commit your work and `git checkout step_two`
