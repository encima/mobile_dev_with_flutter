## Step Five Goals

* Use a custom data class
* Create our own widget to display information
* More with State!

---

## Member

In `code/ex_four/lib/member_model.dart` you will see a `Member` class with some basic information about a Member:
* Name
* Bio
* Website
* Social links

---

## So?

So, now we want to create a widget to show these member details and present them to the user. To do this we need:
* A list of members
* A member info widget
